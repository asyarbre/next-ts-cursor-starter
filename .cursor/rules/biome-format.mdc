description: Biome formatter, linter, and assist rules for this project
---
### Biome, Linting, and Formatting

- **Formatter**: 2-space indent, spaces not tabs. Follow project `biome.json`.
- **Commands**: `pnpm format` to write; `pnpm lint` to check.
- **Organize imports**: Biome assist is enabled for auto import organization.
- **Linter**: Next and React domains are set to `recommended`.
- **CSS at-rules**: `noUnknownAtRules` is disabled to support Tailwind.

#### Authoring Tips
- Keep edits small and focused; avoid reformatting unrelated code.
- Address linter errors before committing changes.
